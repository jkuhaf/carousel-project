# carousel-project

## Requirements:

Fetch items from the API And display them as a carousel. Follow the
design as closely as possible (wireframes are included in the project).

The carousel should show 4 items at a time, and display a total of 16
items. The user should be able to navigate the items using an arrow on
either side of the carousel.

If the item has a video link, please include a button that links to the
video on the item.

Each item should have a heart icon. If the user clicks on the heart, the user
rates the item.

Once an item is rated, that item should disappear. Make sure there is always 16
items on the page.

Please refrain from using a carousel library. Other than that, you can
use any libraries or frameworks you like for this assignment.

## To run the API server:

`npm install && npm run start`

to get items:

`GET localhost:3000/items/?p=${page}&amt=${amt}`

where page is an integer representing page number, and amt is an integer
representing the number of items per page.

to rate an item:

`POST localhost:3000/items/${id}/`

```
{
  rating: 'like' || null
}
```

** The server is reading and writing from disc memory, so there are a limited
number of items available, and it won't save your ratings once it restarts!
